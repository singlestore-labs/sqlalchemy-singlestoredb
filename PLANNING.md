# SingleStoreDB SQLAlchemy dialect

This project is an SQLAlchemy dialect for the SingleStoreDB database. The goal
is to support as many of the SingleStoreDB features in the SQLAlchemy
framework. The SingleStoreDB dialect is based on the MySQL dialect that is
part of SQLAlchemy. SingleStoreDB uses the same protocol as MySQL, but does
add a number of new features not supported by MySQL. Those need to be added
to the SingleStoreDB SQLAlchemy dialect.
